# Dotfiles for my personal setup

This repository contains my personal configurations for various tools and shells. It's designed to streamline the setup process on new machines and to keep my configurations in sync across different devices.

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Oleh-Hudzo/dotfiles.git
```

2. Run the setup script:

```bash
cd dotfiles
./setup.sh
```

The script will create symlinks to the configuration files in your home directory. If a configuration file already exists, it will be backed up.
